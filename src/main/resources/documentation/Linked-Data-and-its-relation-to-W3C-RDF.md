#Link Data and its relation to W3C RDF
Below are two videos <15 minutes in length for some background on [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) and its relation to [W3C RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework).  

RDF is a standardized encoding of facts about data assembled as triples, subject-predicate-object.

[W3C RDFa] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) is an XML-attribute syntax that represents a subset of specified RDF components.  Instances with RDFa content may be processed to extract RDF triples.  RDF triples may then be accessed by [SPARQL-enabled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) analytical and machine learning tools.

This video is a good primer on linked data.  Think of "web pages" as XML documents since HTML is an XML markup language.

I didn't find a good enough RDFa example since it is typically used with HTML.  The following video provides a good example for data exchange.  The RDF encoding is JSON-LD, however, still relevant.  Note the highlights "context" and "id", foundational components of linked data.
