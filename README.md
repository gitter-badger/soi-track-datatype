#SOI Track Datatype
SOI Track is a data type that represents concepts related to tracks, more specifically, observation acts.

An observation act is an observation "associated with a discrete time instant or period through which results are assigned" to a things-of-interest, that is, an entity or activity. The results are obtained by "a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain".  

For example, a military unit's location at discrete time intervals is observed by processing geospatial coordinates communicated by a platform sensor.
