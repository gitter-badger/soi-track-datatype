#SOI Track Datatype
SOI Track is a data type that represents concepts related to tracks, more specifically, observation acts.

An observation act is an observation "associated with a discrete time instant or period through which results are assigned" to a thing-of-interest. The results are obtained by "a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain"[OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E)].  

For example, a military unit's location at discrete time intervals is observed by a platform sensor.
