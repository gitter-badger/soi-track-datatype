#SOI Track Datatype 2.x
SOI Track is a data type that represents concepts related to tracks, or more specifically, observation acts.

An observation act is an observation "associated with a discrete time instant or period through which results are assigned" to a thing-of-interest. The results are obtained by "a specified procedure, such as a sensor, instrument, algorithm or process chain" [OGC and ISO 19156:2011(E), [Observations and Measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_and_Measurements)].  For example, `a military unit's location at discrete time intervals is observed by a platform sensor`.

SOI Track Datatype 2.x meets NIEM Naming and Design Rules 3.0 Schematron conformance rules and generally follows its guidelines.   Notable deviations are with the implementation of RDF ([Resource Description Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)) data components and logical data component relationships.
